# Modern Yu-Gi-Oh! Draft

[License (MIT)](LICENSE.txt)

A small web app simulating a Hearthstone-style draft using the modern Yu-Gi-Oh! card pool.
This is a personal project to solidify and improve on my skills from university as well as boost my resume/portfolio!

### Building

Until this is deployed, here are the dev build steps:

1. Install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) if you don't have it
2. Clone/download the repo through your preferred method
3. Open a terminal and go to into the `backend` folder with it
4. `cargo add` any dependencies you do not have
5. Ensure you don't have any other programs listening on port `localhost:8000`
6. `cargo run` the backend!
7. Leave that terminal running in the background and open a new terminal
8. Use the new terminal to go into the `frontend` folder
9. `cargo add` any missing dependencies and install [Trunk](https://trunkrs.dev/)
10. Ensure you don't have any other programs listening on `localhost:8080`
11. `trunk serve` the frontend! (use `--open` to automatically open the site in your browser)

### Example Deck Stats
For whenever I get to them:
- Main Deck Monster/Spell/Trap ratio
- Main Deck Monster Attribute ratio
- Main Deck Monster subtype ratio (Tuner/Spirit/etc)
- Extra Deck Monster ratio
- Extra Deck Level/Rank ratio (Synchros/XYZ/Links only)
- Link Monsters w/ bottom markers (warn if >1 Links in deck but 0 w/ bottom markers)
- Highest/lowest ATK/DEF values (among applicable cards)
- Spell/Trap subtype ratio

### Draft Balancing Rules
For whenever I get to them:
- All Main Deck monsters are level 4 or lower.
- All monsters are treated as every type.
- All fusion-summoning effects can summon any Fusion Monster, provided all the materials are correct.
- Ritual and Pendulum Monsters are not included due to their inherent need for extremely high levels of synergy that are practically impossible in draft modes.
- The draft alternates between Main Deck and Extra Deck cards. You'll pick 8 Main Deck cards followed by 3 Extra Deck cards, repeated 5 times.
